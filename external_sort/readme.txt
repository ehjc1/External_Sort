command chain preset:

`javac *.java`
`cat <filename> | java CreateRuns <heap size> | java MergeRuns <num files> > <output file name>`
e.g.
`cat BrownCorpus.txt | java CreateRuns 100 | java MergeRuns 100 > out.txt`


limitations:

On one tested pc using linux filestystem, using a heapsize of less than 6 a large file (BrownCorpus.txt),
we ran into a (Too many open files) IO Exception.
This error did not occur with:
- larger heapsize than 6
- another pc test using widnows filesystem regardless of heapsize smaller than 6
- smaller text files as input
